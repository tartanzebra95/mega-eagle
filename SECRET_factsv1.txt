**KOENIG**: Theta Protocol is a go.
**KOENIG**: Your laundry has been done, sir.
**[UNKNOWN]**: Geez, how many ammo shipments do you guys need? I don't think we even used this much in New York. It's not the Tin Man I'm worried about, it's Pepper.
**MAY**: GET. OUT. OF. BED. LAST WARNING. i'm coming up there and dragging you out by the ankle. your cap boxers are going to be on instagram.
**KOENIG**: You know, sir, I watched you. While you were sleeping. 
**KOENIG**: Director, sir, I was wondering if I could get a few more games for my XBox? It's good for morale.
**KOENIG**: Your socks have been ironed, Director.
**[UNKNOWN]**: Good work, Phil, I can hear HYDRA crying from here. You glorious motherfucker.
**KOENIG**: Sir, could you please talk to Skye about not hijacking the Playground's PA system? 'A.K.' is just the *worst* nickname. I prefer 'Deathstalker'.
**KOENIG**: Me and my brothers are putting on a performance of *Singing in the Rain* next weekend, and there's *nothing* you can do about it, sir! You should have thought twice about LMDs coming standard with those nifty invisi-brellas!
**KOENIG**: Sir, you'll be glad to hear that the hole in the elbow of your favorite blazer has been fixed. Looks like new.
**HUNTER**: So, sir, can I borrow Lola? Thirty minutes, tops? I know you said no before (actually you gave me a glare that could probably melt metal, I'm paraphrasing), but I can't really get pizza delivered to a top-secret underground base, can I?
**SKYE**: Okay, what if I hacked you Captain America's cell number? You'd give me the recipe for that killer grilled cheese you made me right?
**FITZ**: im not sure if you'll check this message sir, you're very busy i know, but i don't mind a dog if a monkey's too hard to get hold of at the moment. dogs are nice.
**SIMMONS**: Excuse me, sir, I just wanted to triple-check when the next Peggy Carter/Steve Rogers Fan Club meeting was? I was thinking about making some flyers! I know it's just the two of us at the moment but we need to stay on top of these things. Organisation is key.
**KOENIG**: The Cellist has been moved to a secure location as you ordered, sir.
