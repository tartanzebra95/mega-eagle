**KOENIG**: Theta Protocol is a go.
**KOENIG**: Your laundry has been done, sir.
**[UNKNOWN]**: Geez, how many ammo shipments do you guys need? I don't think we even used this much in New York. It's not the Tin Can I'm worried about, it's Pepper.
**MAY**: GET. OUT. OF. BED. LAST WARNING. i'm coming up there and dragging you out by the ankle. your cap boxers are going to be on instagram.
**KOENIG**: You know, sir, I watched you. While you were sleeping. 
**KOENIG**: Director, sir, I was wondering if I could get a few more games for my XBox? It's good for morale.
**KOENIG**: Your socks have been ironed, Director.
**[UNKNOWN]**: Good work, Phil, I can hear HYDRA crying from here. You glorious motherfucker.
**KOENIG**: Sir, could you please talk to Skye about not hijacking the Playground's PA system? 'A.K.' is just the *worst* nickname. I prefer 'Deathstalker'.
**KOENIG**: Me and my brothers are putting on a performance of *Singing in the Rain* next weekend, and there's *nothing* you can do about it, sir! You should have thought twice about LMDs coming standard with those nifty invisi-brellas!
**KOENIG**: Sir, you'll be glad to hear that the hole in the elbow of your favorite blazer has been fixed. Looks like new.
**HUNTER**: So, sir, can I borrow Lola? Thirty minutes, tops? I know you said no before (actually you gave me a glare that could probably melt metal, I'm paraphrasing), but I can't really get pizza delivered to a top-secret underground base, can I?
**SKYE**: Okay, what if I hacked you Captain America's cell number? You'd give me the recipe for that killer grilled cheese you made me right?
**FITZ**: im not sure if you'll check this message sir, you're very busy i know, but i don't mind a dog if a monkey's too hard to get hold of at the moment. dogs are nice.
**SIMMONS**: Excuse me, sir, I just wanted to triple-check when the next Peggy Carter/Steve Rogers Fan Club meeting was? I was thinking about making some flyers! I know it's just the two of us at the moment but we need to stay on top of these things. Organisation is key.
**KOENIG**: The Cellist has been moved to a secure location as ordered, sir.
**[UNKNOWN]**: I received the upgrade package - did you receive the letter? Please make sure it reaches Ace before his birthday.
**MRS. MAY**: I hope that intel you requested from me was useful. Don't forget to run your harebrained schemes past my daughter before you set them up or you'll regret it.
**MACK**: Sir, I've serviced the SUV and May's Harley, taken a full inventory, cleaned out the garage and vacuumed the Bus. can I please have, idk, a three minute look under Lola's hood?
**GONZALES**: Get your ass back here, Coulson, or I'll be forced to take a hammer to an item of your vintage spy gadget collection every day you're AWOL. Say goodbye to that transistorized blast gun.
**SKYE**: Coulson. u need to un-ground Simmons. like right now. we need her to take a look at the stuff we brought back from mission, and she can't do that when shes been sent to her room like a freakin eight year old! she promises never to say "I'm happy to comply" ever again okay?
**ROO_FACTS**: Thankyou for subscribing to ROO FACTS! Did you know that kangaroos are unable to move backwards easily, because their large tail and feet are unsuited to the action? THE MORE "ROO" KNOW!
**[UNKNOWN]**: Tell "Inspector Gadget" I know he took my garrotte. I'd like it back please, it's my favorite one. Fair's fair.
