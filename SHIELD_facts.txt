Agent Melinda May was initially written as a Caucasian with the name 'Althea Rice'; the name was changed to avoid unfortunate implications when Ming-na Wen landed the part.

Fitz's monkey obsession was inspired by his actor's (Iain De Caestecker) own love of monkeys.

Simmons and her actor Elizabeth Henstridge have the same birthday (11 Sept, 1987), as do Ward and Brett Dalton (7 Jan, 1983).
Ming-na Wen voiced Mulan in the 1998 Disney movie of the same name, and has expressed interest in playing a character in the upcoming *Mulan* live-action remake.
Iain De Caestecker was previously in a BBC short series called *The Fades*, in which his character had a best friend named Mack, woke up from a coma, and saw things no-one else could.
Fitz is the last character of the main six to have his first name mentioned; Agent Weaver introduces him by his full name in *Seeds*.
Hail HYDRA.
Lucy Lawless (Agent Hartley) and Edward James Olmos (Robert Gonzales) have acted together previously in *Battlestar Galactica*, as D'Anna Biers and Commander William Adama respectively.
Both Fitz and his actor (Iain De Caestecker) love a good prank - while filming season 1, Chloe Bennet and De Caestecker waged an escalating prank war against each other. Bennet had to admit defeat when she realized she'd been driving around for three days with a license plate that read 'BallzDeep', courtesy of Iain and the *AoS* prop team.
The tool Fury uses to cut himself out of his SUV in *Captain America: The Winter Soldier* is the Mouse Hole. Fitz invented it and submitted it for testing, but it was rejected.

Agent Shaw, a minor character Coulson extracts in *The Hub*, makes a reappearance in *Turn, Turn, Turn* as one of Hand's trusted agents.
Bill Paxton was told when he was hired that his character was the Clairvoyant and a HYDRA operative; however, the rest of the cast were kept in the dark until the table read for *Turn, Turn, Turn.*
Brett Dalton was only told about Ward being HYDRA during the *Yes Men* shoot.
Elizabeth Henstridge can play the drums, clarinet and piano. She's also an accomplished gymnast and horse rider.
Iain De Caestecker and Elizabeth Henstridge auditioned for FitzSimmons with a version of the medpod scene from *The Beginning of the End*.
There are actually *eight* D.W.A.R.F. bots, not seven, as their names would suggest; there is a bot named Snow, as seen in *0-8-4*.
Simmons' preference for the term 'antiserum' (and not 'vaccine') to describe the cure for the Chitauri virus she and Fitz are trying to make is correct - antiserum is administered to people already suffering from the disease, whereas a vaccine acts to prevent the disease in healthy individuals.
The Bus' call-sign, *S.H.I.E.L.D.-616*, is a reference to Earth-616, the main Marvel Comics universe.
In the pilot, Simmons asks Ward if he's 'excited to be coming on our *journey into mystery*' - this is the name of the 1960's comic series Thor debuted in.
While S1 was filming, Joe Quesada drew a comic strip for the AoS cast called 'Fitz and H.E.N.R.Y.', which was about Fitz getting an AI monkey. The strip now appears in issues of the ongoing *S.H.I.E.L.D.* (2014) comic run.

When Iain De Caestecker and Elizabeth Henstridge were filming the scene in *F.Z.Z.T* where Simmons knocks Fitz out with a fire extinguisher, Henstridge was nervous about hurting De Caestecker, even though the extinguisher was a rubber prop. Iain convinced the make-up crew to fake a very ugly-looking bruise on the back of his neck, and later used it to guilt-trip Elizabeth.
An agent barely got away with their life after obtaining [this](http://40.media.tumblr.com/db2978e1da0d29e77de5036a5f770c42/tumblr_nd39peGhDy1tvkra6o1_1280.jpg) precious intel.

In the Marvel Cinematic Universe, S.H.I.E.L.D. stands for Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division, whereas in the comics universe, it stands for Strategic Hazard Intervention Espionage Logistics Directorate. Either way, it stands for *protection*.
S.H.I.E.L.D. first appeared in *Strange Tales* #135, which was released in 1965. August 2015 will thus mark 50 years of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s existence.

[Here's](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/marvelcinematicuniverse/images/6/6c/Bus_Blueprints.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20141022210405) an enlarged version of the Bus blueprint that hangs behind Coulson's desk in the Bus. Use it wisely.
The two men holding the Guest House in *T.A.H.I.T.I.* don't mention their names at any point. The casting list has them as Alpha (who tells Coulson about the timer before dying) and Beta (the other one).

For agents seeking sustenance between missions, [here](http://shieldtv.net/recipe-making-the-fitz-sandwich)'s how you can make Fitz's favorite sandwich.
In *Repairs*, Ward makes himself a sandwich and eats it during scenes. On the last take, the crew filled it with hot sauce to prank Brett Dalton. The joke was on them, though - Dalton actually liked it!
Skye name-drops Reddit in *The Hub*, when she's talking Simmons through her plan to access the S.H.I.E.L.D. mainframe.
Eric Koenig was one of the original Howling Commandos in the comic mythology, first appearing in *Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos* in the 1960s. Interestingly, an LMD of Eric was used in *Nick Fury vs S.H.I.E.L.D.*.
In *Shadows*, Triplett uses a 'Jones' nametag. This is a reference to his Howling Commando grandfather possibly being [Pvt. Gabriel Jones](http://marvelcinematicuniverse.wikia.com/wiki/Gabe_Jones).
Miles Lydon, Skye's hacker boyfriend in *The Girl in the Flower Dress*, is played by Austin Nichols, who is currently dating Chloe Bennet.
